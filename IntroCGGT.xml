    <p>
      Because the field of geometric group theory is relatively new,
      sounds cool, is cool, and is accessible, it is, in 2020, very
      active and evolving. This also means that geometric group
      theory means different things to different people.
    </p>
    
    <!--p>
      Drutu and Kapovich's imposing 2018 monograph
      <i>Geometric Group Theory</i> arguably gives the most
      comprehensive overview of the field, but it omits certain
      important topics such as CAT(0) cube complexes or
      <m>\mathrm{Out}(F_n)</m> and the spaces it acts on, which are
      touched on in Volume 21 of the IAS/Park City Mathematics
      series titled <i>Geometric Group Theory</i>. And even these do
      not cover some of the author's favourite topics.
    </p!-->
    
    <p>
      Lie groups, for example, are interesting as groups, play a
      critical role in geometry, and would certainly have their place
      in a course in geometric group theory. But, Dynkin diagrams
      notwithstanding, drawings are not a major tool for dealing with
      Lie groups. Furthermore, differential geometry is a prerequisite
      to studying these groups.
    </p>

    <p>
      This course will be a self-contained introduction to the art of
      working with infinite discrete groups by drawing pictures. In
      particular this course has no advanced prerequisites, besides
      mathematical maturity. This constraint will guide the choice of
      topics.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will start with a rigourous exploration of the <m>F(X)</m>,
      the free group on a set <m>X</m> of letters and touch on the
      clasical subject of combinatorial group theory, which is the
      study of groups given by generators and relations. One driving
      question will be: <i>Which calculations can we perform, or which
      algorithmic problems can we solve, in a group given by a certain
      presentation?</i>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our approach to this will be geometrical: group presentations
      enable us to draw Van Kampen diagrams and we will see that in
      the presence of (combinatorial) negative curvature, many
      algorithmic problems become tractable.
    </p>

    <p>Along the way we will touch on many other topics that can be
    explored by the techniques we will develop.</p>

      Much of the material in these lectures is covered in <xref
      ref="book_lyndon-schupp"/>, but this book is difficult to
      read. Stillwell's book <xref ref="book_stillwell"/> has an
      excellent treatement of algorithmic problems and covers many
      crucial interractions between topology and group theory that
      will not be not covered in this course. Both of these books also
      give important historical accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
      Although the ideas of small cancellation theory have been around
      for many decades the paper <xref ref="art_mccammond-wise"/>
      gives a thorough and modern treatment of the topic. Most
      material on hyperbolic groups will be taken from <xref
      ref="notes_hyperbolic"/>.
      </p>

      <p> The book, which as of 2020, gives the best description of
      the field is Drutu and Kapovich's <em>Geometric Group
      Theory</em> <xref ref="book_drutu-kapovich"/>. This book also
      has many historical references. Many important topics not
      covered in this book are covered in <xref ref="GGT-park"/> which
      is also called... <em>Geomeric Group Theory.</em>

    <section xml:id="reductions"><title>Lecture 1: Words and reductions</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a set. We will call <m>X</m> an
      <term>alphabet</term> and we will call its elements
      <term>symbols</term>. For each symbol <m>x \in X</m> take a
      formal inverse <m>x^{-1}</m> and we denote:
      <me>
	 X^{\pm 1} = X \cup \{x^{-1} : x \in X\}.
      </me>
      We further adopt the convention that <m>\left(x^{-1}\right)^{-1}
      = x</m>.
      
      A <term>word</term> in <m>X^{\pm 1}</m> is a string of symbols
      <me>
	w(X) = x_1x_2\cdots x_n
      </me>
      where each symbol <m>x_i \in X^{\pm 1}</m>. In the situation
      where alphabet is clear we will simply write <m>w</m> instead of
      <m>w(X)</m>.   
      
      So, for example, if  <m>X = \{a,b,c\}</m> then <m>X^{\pm 1} = \{a,
      a^{-1}, b, b^{-1},c , c^{-1}\}</m> and the string <me>
      abbac^{-1}b^{-1}ba^{-1}</me> is a word in <m>X^{\pm 1}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given two words <m>w_1,w_2</m> in some alphabet <m>X</m>, we
      denote their <term>concatenation</term> by <m>w_1\ast
      w_2</m>. For example if
      <me>
	w_1 = ab \text{  and  } w_2 = ba,
      </me>
      then <m>w_1\ast w_2 = abba</m>. 
    </p>

    <p>We will state the following proposition without proof, we would
    encourage the reader to prove this for themselves, but since the
    the reader will soon be asked to prove similar statements, we will
    not insist. That being said, <em>composition of functions and
    concatenation are two prototypical associative binary
    operations. </em></p>
    <proposition xml:id="cat-assoc">
      <statement><p>
	Concatenation of words is associative, i.e. <me>
	\left(w_1\ast w_2\right)\ast w_3 = w_1\ast
	\left(w_2\ast w_3\right). </me></p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    
    <p>
      In particular the concatenation of three words <me> w_1\ast
      w_2 \ast w_3
    </me>
    is well defined. Given a word <m>w</m> we will say that <m>u</m>
    is a <term>subword</term> of <m>w</m> if there are words
    <m>w',w''</m>, which may be empty, such that
    <me>
      w = w'\ast u \ast w''.
    </me>
    </p>

    <p> We say that a word <m>w(X)</m> is <term>reduced</term> if it
    has no subwords of the form <m> xx^{-1}</m> where <m>x \in X^{\pm
    1}.</m> We are now in a situation where we can describe the set
    underlying <m>F(X)</m> the <term>free group on alphabet
    <m>X</m></term>.
    </p>

    <p>Let's first consider an analogy with the set <m>\QQ</m> of
    fractions. We can consider fractions to be formal ratios of
    integers, but two different formal ratios, such as <m>\frac 2 4
    \text{ and } \frac 4 8</m>, can be equal. <m>\QQ</m> is therefore
    best thought of the set of ratios of formal ratios of integers
    modulo some eqivalence relation. Furthermore every equivalence
    class of ratios has a reduced element. In <m>\QQ</m> a ratio is
    reduced if the numerator and denominator are relatively prime.</p>

    <p>As a set <m>F(X)</m> can be thought of as the collection of
    words in the alphabet <m>X</m> modulo an equivalence relation
    which we will now define.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="cancellation">
      <statement>
	<p> An <term>elementary cancellation</term> in a word <m>w</m>
	is the operation of deleting a subword of the form
	<m>xx^{-1}</m> where <m>x \in X^{\pm 1}</m>, i.e.<me>
	w = w'\ast xx^{-1} \ast w'' \stackrel{c}{\to} w'\ast w''</me>.
	</p>
	<p> If <m>u</m> is obtained from <m>w</m> by an elementary
	cancellation, i.e. <m>w \stackrel{c}{\to}u</m>, then we say
	that <m>u</m> is obtained from <m>w</m> by an <term>elementary
	insertion</term>. </p>	
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
    So, for example, we have:
    <me>
      bca^{-1}ac \stackrel{c}{\to} bcc.
    </me>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We now define an equivalence relation <m>\stackrel{c}{\sim}</m>
      on the set of words in <m>X</m> as follows:
      <ol>
	<li>
	   For each word we declare <m>w \stackrel c \sim
	   w</m>. (Reflexivity)
	</li>
	<li>
	  We declare <m>w \stackrel c \sim u</m> if <m>w</m> can be
	  brought to <m>u</m> by a sequence of elementary
	  cancellations and elementary insertions.
	</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>Now, on the one hand, given any word, because it has finite
    <term>length</term> (which here means number of symbols) after a
    finite sequence of elementary cancellations we will arrive at a
    reduced word. On the other hand, a given word can admit many
    distinct elementary cancellations, and in particular there are
    many different possible sequences of elementary cancellations
    which bring a word <m>w</m> to its reduced form. We can now state
    the main result of this lecture.</p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_unique_reduced">
      <statement>
	Every word <m>w</m> in an alphabet <m>X</m> has a unique
	reduced form <m>\overline w</m>,
	i.e. if <m>w' \stackrel c \sim w \stackrel c \sim w''</m> and
	both <m>w,w''</m> are reduced, then <m>w'=w''</m>.
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    A restatement of this theorem is that elementary reductions form a

      confluent rewriting system.

    The following exercises will guide the reader through the proof.

    about free groups, is to get the reader to write arguments using
    words and using the technique of induction on word length.
