    <p>
      Because the field of geometric group theory is relatively new,
      sounds cool, is cool, and is accessible, it is, in 2020, very
      active and evolving. This also means that geometric group
      theory means different things to different people.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Lie groups, for example, are interesting as groups, play a
      critical role in geometry, and would certainly have their place
      in a course in geometric group theory. But, Dynkin diagrams
      notwithstanding, drawings are not a major tool for dealing with
      Lie groups. Furthermore, differential geometry is a prerequisite
      to studying these groups.
    </p>

    <p>
      This course will be a self-contained introduction to the art of
      working with infinite discrete groups by drawing pictures. In
      particular this course has no advanced prerequisites, besides
      mathematical maturity. This constraint will guide the choice of
      topics.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will start with a rigorous exploration of the <m>F(X)</m>,
      the free group on a set <m>X</m> of letters and touch on the
      classical subject of combinatorial group theory, which is the
      study of groups given by generators and relations. One driving
      question will be: <i>Which calculations can we perform, or which
      algorithmic problems can we solve, in a group given by a certain
      presentation?</i>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our approach to this will be geometrical: group presentations
      enable us to draw Van Kampen diagrams and we will see that in
      the presence of (combinatorial) negative curvature, many
      algorithmic problems become tractable.
    </p>

    <p>Along the way we will touch on many other topics that can be
    explored by the techniques we will develop.</p>

    <section xml:id="reductions"><title>Lecture 1: Words and reductions</title>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a set. We will call <m>X</m> an
      <term>alphabet</term> and we will call its elements
      <term>symbols</term>. For each symbol <m>x \in X</m> take a
      formal inverse <m>x^{-1}</m> and we denote:
      <me>
	 X^{\pm 1} = X \cup \{x^{-1} : x \in X\}.
      </me>
      We further adopt the convention that <m>\left(x^{-1}\right)^{-1}
      = x</m>.
      
      A <term>word</term> in <m>X^{\pm 1}</m> is a string of symbols
      <me>
	w(X) = x_1x_2\cdots x_n
      </me>
      where each symbol <m>x_i \in X^{\pm 1}</m>. In the situation
      where alphabet is clear we will simply write <m>w</m> instead of
      <m>w(X)</m>.   
      
      So, for example, if  <m>X = \{a,b,c\}</m> then <m>X^{\pm 1} = \{a,
      a^{-1}, b, b^{-1},c , c^{-1}\}</m> and the string <me>
      abbac^{-1}b^{-1}ba^{-1}</me> is a word in <m>X^{\pm 1}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given two words <m>w_1,w_2</m> in some alphabet <m>X</m>, we
      denote their <term>concatenation</term> by <m>w_1\ast
      w_2</m>. For example if
      <me>
	w_1 = ab \text{  and  } w_2 = ba,
      </me>
      then <m>w_1\ast w_2 = abba</m>. 
    </p>

    <p>We will state the following proposition without proof, we would
    encourage the reader to prove this for themselves, but since the
    the reader will soon be asked to prove similar statements, we will
    not insist. That being said, <em>composition of functions and
    concatenation are two prototypical associative binary
    operations. </em></p>
    <proposition xml:id="cat-assoc">
      <statement><p>
	Concatenation of words is associative, i.e. <me>
	\left(w_1\ast w_2\right)\ast w_3 = w_1\ast
	\left(w_2\ast w_3\right). </me></p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    
    <p>
      In particular the concatenation of three words <me> w_1\ast
      w_2 \ast w_3
    </me>
    is well defined. Given a word <m>w</m> we will say that <m>u</m>
    is a <term>subword</term> of <m>w</m> if there are words
    <m>w',w''</m>, which may be empty, such that
    <me>
      w = w'\ast u \ast w''.
    </me>
    </p>

    <p> We say that a word <m>w(X)</m> is <term>reduced</term> if it
    has no subwords of the form <m> xx^{-1}</m> where <m>x \in X^{\pm
    1}.</m> We are now in a situation where we can describe the set
    underlying <m>F(X)</m> the <term>free group on alphabet
    <m>X</m></term>.
    </p>

    <p>Let&apos;s first consider an analogy with the set <m>\QQ</m> of
    fractions. We can consider fractions to be formal ratios of
    integers, but two different formal ratios, such as <m>\frac 2 4
    \text{ and } \frac 4 8</m>, can be equal. <m>\QQ</m> is therefore
    best thought of the set of ratios of formal ratios of integers
    modulo some equivalence relation. Furthermore every equivalence
    class of ratios has a reduced element. In <m>\QQ</m> a ratio is
    reduced if the numerator and denominator are relatively prime.</p>

    <p>As a set <m>F(X)</m> can be thought of as the collection of
    words in the alphabet <m>X</m> modulo an equivalence relation
    which we will now define.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="cancellation">
      <statement>
	<p> An <term>elementary cancellation</term> in a word <m>w</m>
	is the operation of deleting a subword of the form
	<m>xx^{-1}</m> where <m>x \in X^{\pm 1}</m>, i.e.<me>
	w = w'\ast xx^{-1} \ast w'' \stackrel{c}{\to} w'\ast w''</me>.
	</p>
	<p> If <m>u</m> is obtained from <m>w</m> by an elementary
	cancellation, i.e. <m>w \stackrel{c}{\to}u</m>, then we say
	that <m>w</m> is obtained from <m>u</m> by an <term>elementary
	insertion</term>. </p>
	<p>
	  We the identity operation <m>w \to w</m> to simultaneously
	  be a <term>trivial cancellation</term> and a <term>trivial
	  insertion.</term>
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
    So, for example, we have:
    <me>
      bca^{-1}ac \stackrel{c}{\to} bcc.
    </me>
    Is an elementary cancellation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We now define an equivalence relation <m>\stackrel{c}{\sim}</m>
      on the set of words in <m>X</m> as follows:
      <ol>
	<li>
	   For each word we declare <m>w \stackrel c \sim
	   w</m>. (Reflexivity)
	</li>
	<li>
	  We declare <m>w \stackrel c \sim u</m> if <m>w</m> can be
	  brought to <m>u</m> by a sequence of elementary
	  cancellations and elementary insertions.
	</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>Now, on the one hand, given any word, because it has finite
    <term>length</term> (which here means number of symbols) after a
    finite sequence of elementary cancellations we will arrive at a
    reduced word. On the other hand, a given word can admit many
    distinct elementary cancellations, and in particular there are
    many different possible sequences of elementary cancellations
    which bring a word <m>w</m> to its reduced form. We can now state
    the main result of this lecture.</p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm_unique_reduced">
      <statement>
	Every word <m>w</m> in an alphabet <m>X</m> has a unique
	reduced form <m>\overline w</m>,
	i.e. if <m>w' \stackrel c \sim w \stackrel c \sim w''</m> and
	both <m>w,w''</m> are reduced, then <m>w'=w''</m>.
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    A restatement of this theorem is that elementary reductions form a

    <section xml:id="universal"><title>Lecture 2: The free group and
    its universal property</title>
    <p>As the reader should already know, a <term>group</term>
    <m>(G,\cdot)</m> is a pair consisting of a set <m>G</m> and a
    binary operation <m>\star:G\times G \to G</m>, usually called
    <term>multiplication</term>, which satisfies the following axioms:
    <ul>
      <li>The multiplication operation is <term>associative</term>,
      i.e. for all <m>g,h,k \in G</m> we have <me>(g\star h)\star k =
      g\star(h \star k).</me></li>
      <li>There exists an element <m>1_G\in G</m> called the
      <term>identity element</term> such that for every <m>g\in ,
      1_G \star g = g</m>.</li>
      <li>For every <m>g \in G</m> there exists an inverse <m>g^{-1}
      \in G</m> such that <m>g\star g^{-1}=1_G.</m>
      </li>
    </ul>
    We will always denote a group by simply <m>G</m>, we will almost
    always omit the subscript for the identity element, and we will
    usually denote multiplication simply by concatenation, i.e. we&apos;ll
    write stuff like <me>gg^{-1}=1.</me> </p> <p> <m>F(X)</m>, the
    <term>free group on an alphabet <m>X</m></term> consists of the
    set of reduced words in <m>X</m> and multiplication is defined by
    concatenation and reduction, i.e.  <me> u\star v = \overline{u*v},
    </me> where <m>*</m> denotes concatenation of strings.  The
    identity <m>1_{F(X)}</m> is the empty word (i.e. the word with
    zero symbols in it). Associativity amounts to showing that
    <me>
      (u\star v)\star w = \overline{\overline{u * v} * w} = \overline{
      u* \overline{v * w}} = u\star (v\star w),
    </me>
    which immediately follows from <xref
    ref="thm_unique_reduced"/>. We leave the third group axiom as
    <xref ref="ex_free_gp_inv"/>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The free group plays a crucial role because of the following
    <term>universal property.</term>
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_free_gp_universal"><title>The universal

  </theorem>

  <p>
    Our approach to Theorem <xref ref="thm_free_gp_universal"/> hinges
    on a consequence of associativity: <term>generalized
    associativity</term>. Since it is difficult to get excited about
    associativity, some discussion is in order.
  </p>

  <p> Division <m>\div</m> is not associative, which means that
  expressions of the form <m>12\div 12 \div 12</m> are not well
  defined:<me> \frac{1}{12} = (12\div 12) \div 12 \neq 12\div(12\div
  12) = 12.</me> Different bracketings give different results. In the
  previous lecture associativity was used to say that a product of
  three elements <m>w_1\star w_2 \star w_3</m> is well-defined, which
  in turn enables us to define subwords. So what about arbitrary
  products such as
  <me>
    g_1g_2\cdots g_n = \prod_{i=1}^n g_i
  </me>?
  The issue here is that our group operation is a <em>binary
  operation</em>. Bracketing simply gives the order in which we
  perform the multiplication operations, multiplying two elements at a
  time. Associativity only says that products of three factors are
  well defined. We will say that a product is <term>nice</term> if it
  looks like
  <me>
    a_1*(a_2*(a_3*a_4))
  </me>
  and other wise a product like <me> ((a_1*a_2)*(a_3*a_4))*a_5</me> is
  called <term>messy</term>. This terminology is neither standard nor
  particularly good. In fact we didn&apos;t even give precise
  definitions. In <xerv ref="ex_nice"/> you are asked to give a
  precise recursive definition of a nice product and then you will be
  asked to prove the following:
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_gen_assoc"><title>Generalized
  associativity</title>
  <statement>
    Any messy product can be turned into a nice product by a sequence
    of applications of the associativity axiom. Furthermore the order
    the factors is preserved.
  </statement>
  </theorem>

  From which the following immediately follows:

  <corollary xml:id="cor_products">
    <statement>
      In any group (or any algebraic structure with an associative
      binary operation) long products <me>
      g_1\cdots g_n = \prod_{i=1}^n g_i; g_i \in G
    </me>
    are well-defined.
    </statement>
  </corollary>

  <p>
  Here is why we care. Suppose you are given some <m>\varphi:X \to
  G</m> which maps each letter of the alphabet to arbitrary elements
  of <m>G</m>, then we can extend this to a function <m>\varphi^*:
  F(X)\to G</m>. Indeed let <m>w = a_1^{\epsilon_1}\cdots
  a_n^{\epsilon_n}</m>, where each <m>a_i \in X</m> and each
  <m>\epsilon_i \in \{1,-1\}</m>, be some arbitrary element of
  <m>F(X),</m> then we set
  <men xml:id="eq_free_gp">
  \varphi^*(w) = \prod_{i=1}^n\varphi(a_i)^{\epsilon_i}, </men> which
  is a product of elements of <m>G</m>. Generalized associativity
  ensures that this mapping is <em>well-defined.</em> Showing that this is a
  homomorphism is left as an exercise.
  </p>

  <p>If, so far, our treatment has seemed rather formal, this is
  because our goal up to now was to construct a group using nothing
  but the axioms of group theory and some set of letters we had lying
  around and then to show it is satisfied a universal property in the
  category of groups, i.e. <xref ref="thm_free_gp_universal"/>. Such
  universal constructions in algebra look this way.</p>

  <p>It is also worth noting that everybody just seems to assume
  generalized associativity. We will do the same in subsequent
  lectures, in fact we won&apos;t even mention it again, but at least we
  are assured that long products are well defined.</p>
  
  <p>
    We end this lecture with the following result which algebraically
    characterizes free groups.
  </p>
  <corollary xml:id="cor_free_gp">
    <statement>
      Let <m>G</m> be some group with a subset <m>Y\subset G</m> such
      that for any group <m>H</m> and any map <m>f:Y \to H</m>, there is
      an extension of <m>f</m> to a homomorphism <m>f^*:G \to
      H</m>. Then <m>G</m> is isomorphic to the free group
      <m>F(Y)</m>.
    </statement>
  </corollary>
  Recall that although we would call the set <m>Y</m> an alphabet and
  its elements letters, the alphabet can be any set, even elements of
  another group. For clarity, however, we make a copies of sets in the
  proof below.

  <proof>
    <p>
      For clarity let us take <m>X</m> to be a copy of <m>Y</m>,
      i.e. we have a bijection <m>\psi:X\to Y</m> and we denote its
      inverse <m>\phi:Y \to X</m>. We consider <m>Y\subset G</m> and
      <m>X \subset F(X)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>      
      By <xref ref="thm_free_gp_universal"/> there is a homomorphism
      <m>\psi^*:F(X) \to G</m> which extends <m>\psi</m>. By
      hypothesis there is also a homomorphism <m>\phi^*:G \to F(X)</m>
      which extends <m>\phi</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>w = \prod_{i=1}^n x_i</m>, where <m>x_i \in X^{\pm 1}</m>
      be an arbitrary element of <m>F(X)</m>. Then by the definition
      of a homomorphism and generalized associativity we have:<me>
      \phi^*\circ\psi^*\left( \prod_{i=1}^n x_i\right)= \prod_{i=1}^n
      \phi^*\circ\psi^*(x_i) = \prod_{i=1}^n x_i, </me> since on
      <m>X</m>, <m>\phi^*\circ\psi^*= \phi\circ\psi = Id.</m> 
    </p>

    <p>The homomorphisms <m>\psi^*,\phi^*</m> are therefore inverses
    of each other; and thus are isomorphisms.</p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    Any subset <m>Y</m> of a group <m>G</m> with this universal
    mapping property is called a <term>basis of <m>G</m></term>, and
    since we&apos;re <em>free</em> to send elements of <m>Y</m>
    wherever we want, we say that <m>G</m> is a free group with basis
    <m>Y</m>. As is the case in linear algebra, bases are never
    unique, but that is for another lecture (not the next one)!

    Generating and presenting groups</title>
    <p>
      Long products are group elements are important to us. The
      following lemma gives us a definition of <term>a subgroup
      generated by a collection of elements</term>
    </p>
      <lemma xml:id="lem_generate">
	<statmement>
	  Let <m>H \leq G</m> be a subgroup and let
	  <m>S=\{h_1,\ldots\} \subset G</m> be a set of
	  elements. The following are equivalent:
	  <ul>
	    <li><m>H</m> is the smallest subgroup of <m>G</m>
	    containing <m>S</m>, i.e.
	    <me>
	      H = \bigcap_{S\subset K \leq G} K,
	    </me> i.e. the intersection of all subgroups of <m>G</m>
	    containing <m>S</m>.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <m>H</m> consists of all products of elements <m>S^{\pm
	      1}</m>, i.e. <me> H = \left\{h_{i_1}^{\epsilon_1}\cdots
	      h_{i_n}^{\epsilon_n} \in G \mid h_{i_j}\in S, \epsilon_j
	      \in \{\pm 1\}, n \in \ZZ_{\geq 0} \right\}
	    </me>
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</statmement>
      </lemma>
    <p>
      We will denote the subgroup generated by
      <m>S=\{h_1,\ldots\}</m> as <m>\gen S</m> or
      <m>\gen{h_1,\ldots}</m>.
    </p>
    <proof>
      <p>
      Let us denote by <m>H</m> the smallest subgroup containing
      <m>S</m> and by <m>\gen S</m> set of products of elements in
      <m>S^{\pm 1}</m>. <m>\gen S</m> is closed under multiplication
      and taking inverses so it&apos;s a subgroup of <m>G</m>. By
      definition, it&apos;s therefore immediate that <m>H \subset \gen S</m>.
      </p>

      
      <p>
      To see that <m>H \supset \gen S</m>, we proceed by induction on
      the length of a product. By definition any product of length 1,
      being an element of <m>S^{\pm 1}</m>, is in <m>H</m>. If every
      product of length at most <m>n</m> is in <m>H</m>, then, because
      a product of length <m>n+1</m> is a product of a product of
      length <m>n</m> and a product of length <m>1</m> and because
      <m>H</m>, being a subgroup, is closed under multiplication,
      every product of length <m>n+1</m> is also in
      <m>H</m>. Therefore, by induction, <m>H \supset \gen S</m> and
      equality follows.
      </p> 
    </proof>
    <p>
    Any set <m>S \subset G</m> such that <m>G = \gen S</m> is
    called a <term>generating set of G</term>.  If <m>G</m> has a
    finite generating subset <m>\{g_1,\cdots,g_k\}\subset G</m> then
    we way <m>G</m> is <term>finitely generated.</term>

    The <term>rank</term> of a group <m>G</m> is the minimal
    cardinality achieved by its generating sets, though this
    terminology is less standard and typically has other meanings in
    different group theoretical contexts.
    </p>

    <p> Since <m>G = \gen G</m>, every finite group is finitely
    generated and it is a standard fact that every symmetric group
    <m>S_n</m> has rank 2. It&apos;s already more impressive when an
    infinite group has finite rank. Here are three examples:
    <ul>
      <li>
	If <m>X = \{a,b,c\}</m> then the free group <m>F(X)</m> has
	rank 3. In general if <m>|X|=n</m> then we will say that
	<m>F(X)</m> is a <term>free group of rank <m>n</m>.</term>
      </li>
      <li>
	<m>\GL 2 \ZZ</m>, the group of <m>2\times 2</m> invertible
	matrices with <m>\ZZ</m> coefficients also has rank 2, indeed
	it is generated by elementary matrices:
	<me>
	  \GL 2 \ZZ = \gen{
	  \begin{bmatrix}
	  0&amp;1\\
	  1&amp;0
	  \end{bmatrix},
	  \begin{bmatrix}
	  1&amp;1\\
	  0&amp;1
	  \end{bmatrix}
	  }.
	</me>
      </li>
      <li>
	<m>\pi_1(M)</m>, where <m>M</m> is a compact finite
	dimensional manifold is also finitely generated.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>If <m>\gen S =G</m>, then by <xref
    ref="thm_free_gp_universal"/>, there is an epimorphism, or a
    surjective homomorphism, <m>\varphi:F(S) \onto G</m>. So it is immediate
    that if <m>G</m> has rank <m>n</m> then it is the homomorphic
    image of a free group of rank <m>n</m>.</p>

    <p>
      In any case if <m>G = \gen S</m> and <m>X</m> is any alphabet
      such that <m>|X| = |S|</m>, by the First Isomorphism Theorem for
      groups we have
      <me>
	F(X)/\ker(\varphi) \approx G.
      </me>     
    </p>

    <p>
      Let us fix some more terminology before continuing. If <m>g,h
      \in G</m>, then the <term>conjugate of <m>g</m> by
      <m></m>h</term> is
      <me>
	g^h = h^{-1} g h.
      </me> Some people write <m>g^h = h g h^{-1}</m>, but they are
      <em>wrong</em> because we should have <m>(g^h)^k =
      g^{hk}</m>. Although it looks weird, it makes more sense to write
      <me>
	{~}^h g = h gh^{-1} = g^{h^{-1}}.
	</me> The correct notation is
	consistent with the concepts of left and right actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recall that a normal subgroup <m>N \triangleleft G</m> is a
      subgroup that is closed under conjugation by arbitrary elements
      in <m>G</m>, and the class of normal subgroups coincides with
      the kernels of homomorphisms from <m>G</m>. Consider now the
      concept of <term>normal generation</term>:
    </p>
    <proposition xml:id="prop_normal_gen">
      <statement>
	Let <m>R\subset G</m> be some subset. Then
	the smallest normal subgroup of <m>G</m> containing <m>R</m>
	coincides with
	<me>
	  \ncl R = \left\{\prod_{i=1}^n c_i^{-1}r_i^{\epsilon_i} c_i
	  \middle |
	  r_i \in R,\epsilon_i \in \{\pm 1\}, c_i \in G, n \in
	  \ZZ_{\geq 0}\right\},
	</me> the set of products of conjugates of elements in
	<m>R^{\pm 1}</m>.
      </statement>
    </proposition>
    <p>
    We leave the proof to <xref ref="ex_normal_gen"/>.
    </p>

    <p>
      So if <m>R \subset F(X)</m> is a subset then we call we call the
      the pair <m>\pres X R</m> a <term>presentation</term> for the
      group
      <me>
	F(X)/\ncl R.
      </me>
      The set <m>X</m> is called the <term>generators</term> and the
      set <m>R</m> is called the <term>relations.</term>
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of the course we will make the following
      abuse of notation. If there is an epimorphisms <m>f:F(X) \onto
      G</m> and <m>\ker(f) = \ncl R</m> then we will just go ahead and
      write
      <me>
	G = \pres X R.
      </me>
      There will come a time we will need to be subtle about the fact
      that <m>\pres X R</m> is just a set of letters and a set of
      strings separated by a pipe inside angled brackets and that in
      fact <m> G \approx F(X)/\ncl R</m>. When that time comes we will
      say so. If there exists some <m>R \subset F(X)</m> such that
      <m>G = \pres X R</m> and <m>|R|\lt\infty</m>, then we will say
      that <m>G</m> is <term>finitely presentable</term> and if the set
      <m>R</m> is explicitly given, then <m>G</m> is said to be
      <term>finitely presented</term>. We will not usually make a
      distinction between these two terms and <em>we will usually just
      say that <m>G</m> is finitely presented.</em>
    </p>


    <p>
      By expressing <m>G = \pres X R</m>, we are identifying <m>G</m>
      with the set of words in <m>X</m> modulo the equivalence
      relation generated by the following rewriting rules
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Elementary cancellations, and their inverses.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Insertion of subwords from <m>R</m>, i.e. write <m>w</m> as
	  a word and "splice in" <m>r</m> somewhere:
	  <me>
	    w = w_1*w_2 \to w_1*r*w_2,
	  </me>
	  for some <m>r \in R</m>, and the inverse operation: deleting
	  a subword that lies in <m>R</m>
	</li>
      </ul>
      The group multiplication operation is again concatenation of
      words. The last two exercises are about this group of strings
      with this rewriting system.

  <section xml:id="lec_cayley_graphs"><title>Lecture 4: Cayley
  graphs</title>

  <p>
    So far we have been very combinatorial. Let&apos;s get geometric!
    First recall that a directed graph <m>Z</m> consists of a set
    <m>V</m> of <term>vertices</term> and a set <m>E \subset V\times
    V</m> of directed <term>edges</term>. If we want we can also
    <term>label</term> the directed edges using some symbol from some
    alphabet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Given a generating set <m>S\subset G</m> of a group <m>G</m> we
    can form a <term>Cayley graph</term>, denoted <m>\cay S G</m>, by
    taking the vertex set be the set <m>G</m> itself and for each <m>a
  \in S</m> and each <m>g \in G</m> we draw the directed edge labelled
  <m>a</m> from <m>g</m> to <m>ga</m>:
    <image width="15%" xml:id="cayley_edge">
      <latex-image>
	\begin{tikzpicture}[xscale =2]
	\node[vertex] (u) at (0,0) {};
	\node[vertex] (v) at (1,0) {};
	
	\draw (u)--node[sloped]{$\blacktriangleright$}(v);
	\path (u) --node[above]{$a$} (v);
	\draw (u) node[above]{$g$} ;
	\draw (v) node[above]{$ga$} ;
	\end{tikzpicture}
      </latex-image>,
    </image>
    where the group element is drawn above the vertex. Thus <m>g =
    a_1\cdots a_n.</m>
  </p>

  <p>Let&apos;s do an example. Consider <m>D_{2\times 3}</m>, the
  dihedral group of order 6, or the symmetry group of the triangle. It
  is generated by <m>\rho</m>, the clockwise rotation by
  <m>120^\circ</m>, and <m>r</m> the reflection about the vertical
  axis. We let <m>D_{2 \times 3}</m> act on the left.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is known that <m>D_{2\times 3}</m> has 6 elements, we draw
    its Cayley graph <m>\cay{\{\rho,r\}}{D_{2\times 3}}</m> here
    where next to each vertex <m>g \in G</m> we have the result of
    applying <m>g</m> to the triangle.
    <figure xml:id="fig_cay_d6">
      <caption>The Cayley graph <m>\cay{\{\rho,r\}}{D_{2\times
      3}}</m></caption>
      <image width="75%" xml:id="D6_gens" source="images/Cay_D6.png"/>
    </figure>
    Note that our left action convention means that, say, the element
    <m>r\rho</m>, mean "first rotate, then reflect. The result is that
    the transformed triangles in <xref ref="fig_cay_d6"/> don't
    immediately look in the right place.    
  </p>

  <p>
    Because they are highly symmetric, Cayley graphs are aesthetically
    pleasing, and they essentially play the role of a multiplication
    table in a group. Unfortunately (see <xref ref="ex_S3_cay"/>) a
    group has multiple Cayley graphs, depending on the choice of
    generating set. 
  </p>


  <p>
    Infinite groups also have Cayley graphs. Consider for example
    <m>\ZZ\oplus\ZZ = \ZZ^2</m> which is the set
    <me>
      \ZZ^2= \{(n,m) \mid n,m \in \ZZ\}
    </me>
    equipped with component-wise addition. If we take generators <m>a =
    (1,0)</m> and <m>b=(0,1)</m> then <m>\cay{\{a,b\}}{\ZZ^2}</m> looks
    like:
    <figure xml:id="fig_cay_ZZ2">
      <caption>A Cayley graph for  <m>\ZZ^2</m></caption>
      <image width="75%" xml:id="cay_ZZ2" source="images/Cay-Z2.png">
      </image>
    </figure>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Every edge <m>e</m> in a directed labelled graph has an
    <term>initial</term> vertex <m>\iota(e)</m>, a
    <term>terminal</term> vertex <m>\tau(e)</m> and a label
    <m>\lab(e)</m>. For example if <m>e=(u,v)</m>, where <m>u,v</m> are
    vertices then <m>\iota(e)=u,\tau(e)=v</m>. We may define the
    <term>formal inverse</term> <m>e^{-1}</m> of an edge <m>e</m> so
    that <m>\tau(e)=\iota(e^{-1})</m> and <m>\tau(e^{-1})=\iota(e)</m>
    and the label <m>\lab(e^{-1}) = \lab(e)^{-1}.y</m>
  </p>
  <p>
    A <term>path</term> in a directed graph <m>Z</m> with edge set
    <m>E</m> is a sequences of edges and formal inverses:
    <me>
      \alpha: e_1\cdots e_n; e_i \in E^{\pm 1}
    </me>
  that "connect together", i.e. <m>\tau(e_i) = \iota(e_{i+1})</m> for
  <m>1\leq i \lt n</m>. The <term>initial point</term> of a path is
  the vertex <m>\iota(e_1)</m> and the <term>terminal vertex</term> is
  the vertex <m>\tau(e_n)</m>. We say that the path <m>\alpha</m>
  <term>goes from its initial vertex to its terminal
  vertex</term>. Here&apos;s an example:
  <image width="15%" xml:id="graph_path">
      <!-- picture of a path in a graph -->
  </image>
  A path is said to be <term>reduced</term> if it has no subpaths of
  the form <m>e e^{-1}</m> for some <m>e \in E^{\pm 1}</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is similar to our treatment of words in an alphabet. The only
    distinction is that you can only concatenate paths if one starts
    where the other ends. Otherwise there is associativity and even a
    reduction procedure where we successively delete subpaths of the
    form <m>ee^-1</m> which we can call
    <term>tightening</term>. Everything works out like in <xref
    ref="reductions"/>, we can even define inverses. Such a structure,
    which is almost like a group except that multiplication is not
    always defined is called a <term>groupoid</term>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the reader has any experience with fundamental groups in
    topology, then this should also look familiar, as all we are doing
    here is giving a combinatorial treatment of a path:
    <me>
      f:[0,1] \to Z
    </me>
    where the graph <m>Z</m> is thought of as a topological
    space. Specifically, a CW complex with 0 and 1 dimensional cells.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Given a path <m>\alpha = e_1\cdots e_n</m>, we will say that its
    <term>length</term> is <m>n</m>, the number of edges is contains
    and its <term>label</term> is the word
    <me>
      \lab(\alpha) = \lab(e_1)\cdots\lab(e_n).
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    The whole point of <xref ref="reductions"/> was that in a free
    group on a specified alphabet distinct reduced words correspond to
    distinct elements. Once relations are added this is no longer the
    case. Indeed if <m>G = \pres X R</m> and given two distinct
    reduced words <m>w</m> and <m>w&apos;</m> in the alphabet <m>X</m>
    it may be that <m> w \neq_{F(X)} w&apos;</m> (i.e. they are
    distinct reduced words) but that viewed as products of generators
    of <m>G</m> we have <m>w =_G w&apos;</m>, i.e. they have the same
    image via the standard map <m>F(X) \to \pres X R</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Cayley graph illustrates this nicely:

<section xml:id="sec_homs_tietze">
  <title>Lecture 5: Homomorphisms and Tietze transformations</title>
  <p>  Let&apos;s return to group presentations. In the previous lectures
we drew Cayley graphs for <m>D_{6 \times 3}</m> and <m>\ZZ^2</m>, we
  will now try to compute presentations. Before continuing <em>a word
  of caution:</em> in general, working with presentations is very
  tricky. Specifically (and we will discuss this properly in a couple
  lectures) there is not general procedure which determines if a
  finite presentation gives a nontrivial group.</p>

  <p>Let's start with a presentation for <m>D_{2\times 3}</m>. We saw
  in Lecture <xref ref="lec_cayley_graphs"/> that <m>D_{2\times 3}</m>
  was generated by elements <m>\rho,r</m>. Therefore by the universal
  property of free groups there is a surjective homomorphism:
  <md>
    <mrow>\amp \varphi: F(r,\rho) \onto D_{2\times 3}</mrow>
    <mrow>\amp \Rightarrow D_{2\times 3} \approx F(r,\rho)/\ker(\varphi)</mrow>
  </md>
  and we are left to find a normal generating set for
  <m>\ker(\varphi)</m>. We must be careful because adding relations
  has consequences, so we must not add too many. We first note that
  the following elements are trivial in <m>D_{2\times 3}</m>:
  <me>
    \rho\rho\rho=_{D_{2\times 3}} rr =_{D_{2\times 3}} r\rho r \rho
    =_{D_{2\times 3}} 1.
  </me>
It therefore follows that <m>\ncl{\rho\rho\rho,rr,r\rho r\rho} \leq
\ker\varphi</m> which means that there is a surjective homomorphism
<men xml:id="eq_d6_pres">
  \pres{r,\rho}{\rho\rho\rho,rr,r\rho r\rho}\onto D_{2\times 3}.
</men>
In other words, we have not added too many relations, we must now
verify that we have added sufficiently many relations. In order to
show this we will use a <term>normal forms argument</term>. We will
show that for the group <m>H = \pres{r,\rho}{\rho\rho\rho,rr,r\rho
r\rho}</m>, we will be able to use the relations to rewrite any
element as
<men xml:id="eq_d6_nf">
  w(r,\rho) =_H \rho^i r^j; 0\leq i \leq 2, 0\leq j \leq 1
</men>
so that <m>H</m> has only 6 elements and there fore the mapping <xref
ref="eq_d6_pres"/> is not only surjective, but also injective and
therefore and isomorphism.
  </p>

  <p>
    The relations <m>\rho\rho\rho=1</m> and <m>rr=1</m> imply that any
    word <m>w(\rho,r)</m> in <m>H</m> can be written as an alternation
    of powers of <m>\rho</m> of exponent between 0 and 2, and of the
    letter <m>r</m>, for example <me> \rho^2 r \rho^2 r \rho r \rho.
    </me>
    We now want to show that any word can be brought to the desired
    form.
  </p>

  <p>
    Suppose that the final factor was of the form <m>\rho^m</m>
    so that<me> w = \cdots r \rho^m</me> then we can splice-in the
    inverse of a relation so that:<me> w = \cdots r \rho \rho^{m-1} =
    \cdots r \rho (\rho^{-1}r^{-1}\rho^{-1}r^{-1})\rho^{m-1} = \cdots
    \rho^{-1}r^{-1} \rho^{m-1}</me> and since <me> r^{-1} = r^{-1}(rr)
    =r</me> we have <me> w = \cdots\rho^{-1}r \rho^{m-1}</me>
    repeating this process removes the last <m>\rho</m> power
    syllable. This is progress, but the argument is tiresome!
  </p>

  <p>
    Although we could do everything by splicing in and deleting
    relations, applying elementary reductions and their inverses, we
    can also just use group theory to replace subwords by equal
    elements.
  </p>
  <p>
   In <m>H</m> we have <men xml:id="eq_d6_commute"> r \rho r \rho =1
   \Rightarrow r \rho = \rho^{-1}r^{-1} = \rho^2 r </men> which means
   we can can simply replace any subword <m>\cdots r\rho \cdots</m> by
   <m> \cdots \rho^2r\cdots </m>. In this manner, we can "commute" all
   the <m>\rho</m> symbols to the left of the word, giving <m>w =
   \rho^k r^j</m>, and since <m>\rho^3=r^2=1</m> the exponents
   <m>k,j</m> can be taken to be division remainders so we can rewrite
   any word in <m>H</m> as in <xref ref="eq_d6_nf"/>. Therefore the 3
   relations <m>\rho\rho\rho, rr, r\rho r\rho</m> ensure the group has
   6 elements.
  </p>
  
  <p> Let us now consider homomorphisms given from groups with
  presentations.</p>
  <lemma xml:id="lem_pres_hom">
    <statement>
      Let <m>G</m> be some group and let <m>H = \pres X R</m> be a
      group given by a presentation. A mapping <m>\varphi^*:X \to
      G</m> extends to homomorphism <m>\varphi:H \to G</m> if and only
      if for each <m>r(X) = x_1^{\epsilon_1}\cdots x_n^{\epsilon_n} \in
      R</m>, where <m>x_i \in X, \epsilon_i \in \{\pm 1\}</m> upon
      substitution in <m>G</m> we get:
      <me>
	\varphi^*(x_1)^{\epsilon_1} \cdots \varphi^*(x_n)^{\epsilon_n}
	=_G 1.
      </me>
    </statement>
  </lemma>
  <p>
    One consequence of this equations. Let <m>G</m> be a group, let
    <m>x_1,\ldots,x_n</m> be a collection of unknowns and consider a
    system of equations:
    <me>
      \mathcal{E} :\left\{
      \begin{array}{l}
      r_1(X) = x_{i_{11}}^{\epsilon_{11}}\cdots
      x_{i_{1c_1}}^{\epsilon_{1c_1}}=_G 1\\
      \cdots\\
      r_m(X) = x_{i_{m1}}^{\epsilon_{m1}}\cdots x_{i_{mc_m}}^{\epsilon_{mc_m}}=_G 1\\
      \end{array}
      \right.,
    </me>
    where <m>x_{i_{jk}} \in X</m> and <m>\epsilon_{jk} \in \{\pm
    1\}</m>. Then the solutions of <m>\mathcal E</m> are precisely the
    given by the homomorphisms
    
    <me>
      \pres{x_1,\ldots,x_n}{r_1,\cdots,r_m} \to G.
    </me>
  </p>

  
  <p>
    As we saw in the previous lecture, different choices of generating
    sets gave different Cayley graphs. We will now describe all
    possible presentations of a group.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let <m>\mathcal P = \pres X R</m> be a presentation (not a group,
    but a formal presentation) and consider the following three
    <term>Tietze</term> transformations.
    <ul>
      <li><term>T1: The dictionary transformation.</term><me>
      \pres X R \to \pres{X \cup \{y\}}{R\cup\{y^{-1}w(X)\}},
    </me>
    where <m>y \not\in X</m> and <m>w(X)</m> is a word in <m>X</m>.
    Informally, add a new symbol for an element <m>y</m> and say that
    <me>
      y = w(X) \Leftrightarrow y^{-1}w(X)=1.
    </me>
    So that they new symbol <m>y</m> is just "shorthand" for the
    element <m>w(X)</m>.
      </li>
      <li><term>T2: Add a redundant relation.</term><me>
      \pres X R \to \pres{X}{R\cup\{r'\}},</me> where <m>r' \in \ncl
      R</m>. Informally, add a relation <m>r'</m> which is already a
      consequence of the relations in <m>R</m>.</li>
      <li><term>T3: Rename a symbol.</term> Take some symbol <m>z
      \not\in X</m>, take <m>X'=(X\setminus \{x\})\cup\{z\}</m> and do
      <me>\pres X R \to \pres{X'}{R'},</me> where <m>R'</m> is
      obtained by replacing every instance of <m>x</m> by <m>z</m> in
      every word in <m>R.</m></li>
    </ul>
    <xref ref="ex_tietze_1"/> is to show that these transformations
    yield presentations defining isomorphic groups. Note that the
    inverse of T1 involves deleting a generator and a very specific
    type of relation and the inverse of T2 involves removing a
    relation that is a consequence of the remaining relations.

  <section xml:id="sec_alg_prob"><title> Lecture 6: Algorithmic
  problems in group theory and elements of recursion theory</title>
  <p>
    Our combinatorial approach to group theory naturally turns groups
    into computational objects: sets of strings with rewriting
    rules. In the 1920s Max Dehn proposed the following three
    algorithmic problems:
    <ul>
      <li>
	<term>The word problem:</term> Given a group presentation <m>G
	= \pres X R</m> and word <m>w(X)</m> in the alphabet <m>X</m>
	determine if <m>w(X)=_G 1</m>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<term>The conjugacy problem:</term> Given a group presentation
	<m>G = \pres X R</m> and words <m>w(X),u(X)</m> in the
	alphabet <m>X</m> determine if <em>there exists</em> some <m>g
	\in G</m> such that <m>g^{-1}w(X)g=_G u(X).</m>
      </li>
      <li>
	<term>The isomorphism problem:</term> Given two group
	presentations <m>\pres X R</m> and <m>\pres Y S</m> determine
	if they define isomorphic groups.
      </li>
    </ul>    
  </p>
  <p>
    First the bad news:
    <theorem xml:id="thm_novikov_boone"><title>The Novikov-Boone
    theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>There exists a finitely presented group
      <m>G=\pres{x_1,\ldots,x_n}{r_1,\ldots,r_m}</m> for which the
      word problem is undecidable.</p>
    </statement>
    </theorem>

    Let's explain this result in more detail. There exists a group
    presentation which you can actually write out so that for any
    algorithm you come up with, for example a computer program written
    in Python, to determine <em>correctly</em> whether words are equal
    to the trivial element, there will be a word (in fact many, many
    words) for which your algorithm will never terminate.    
  </p>

  <p> We say a set <m>S</m> is <term>recursively enumerable</term> or
  <term>r.e.</term> if there is some algorithm <m>\mathfrak A</m>
  which enumerates the elements of <m>S</m>.
  <proposition xml:id="prop_trivial_re"><title>Trivial elements are
  recursively enumerable</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>G=\pres {x_1,\ldots,x_n}{r_1,\ldots,r_m}</m> be a
      finitely presented group. Then the set
      <me>
	\mathcal E = \left\{w(X) \mid w(X) \textrm{ is reduced and }
	w(X)=_G 1\right\} </me> of reduced words equal to <m>1</m> is
	recursively enumerable.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      By <xref ref="prop_normal_gen"/> the set <m>\mathcal E</m>
      consists of taking all products
      <me>
	\prod_{i=1}^n c_i^{-1}r_{j_i}^{\epsilon_i}c_i
      </me>
    </p> where <m>r_{j_i} \in \{r_1,\cdots,r_m\}, \epsilon_i \in \{\pm
    1\}</m> and then performing free reduction. Consider the sets
    <m>\mathcal E_N</m> consisting of all products consisting of at
    most <m>N</m> factors <m>c_i^{-1}r_{j_i}c_i</m>, and where each
    conjugator also has length at most <m>N</m>. Then <m>\mathcal
    E_N</m> is recursively enumerable for each <m>N</m> therefore so
    must the countable union<me> \mathcal E = \bigcup_{N=1}^{\infty}
    \mathcal E_N.
  </me>
  </proof>
  </proposition>
  </p>
  <p>
    Although enumeration seems somewhat contrived, it is fact
    equivalent the more mathematically natural concept of set
    membership.
    <proposition xml:id="prop_re_membership">
      <statement>
	<p> Let <m>S</m> be a set of strings of symbols in some
	alphabet <m>X</m>. The following are equivalent:
	<ul>
	  <li>There exists a <term>membership algorithm</term>
	  <m>\mathfrak A</m> which takes as inputs strings in <m>X</m>
	  with the following property: <m>s \in S</m> if and only if
	  <m>\mathfrak A</m> terminates on the input <m>s</m>.</li>
	  <li> <m>S</m> is recursively enumerable. </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
	<p>
	  Suppose first you are given the algorithm <m>\mathfrak A</m>
	  as in the statement of the proposition. Let
	  <m>w_1,w_2,\ldots</m> be an enumeration of the strings in
	  <m>X</m> and let <m>\mathfrak M_N</m> be a program which
	  performs the <m>N</m> first steps of <m>\mathfrak A</m> on
	  the inputs <m>w_1,\ldots,w_N</m>. If one of the parallel
	  processes terminates then <m>\mathfrak N</m> outputs the
	  string <m>w_j</m> of the corresponding terminating
	  process. Then our enumeration algorithm is an algorithm
	  which sequentially runs
	  <m>\mathfrak N_{1},\mathfrak N_2,\ldots</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Conversely suppose <m>S</m> is <m>r.e.</m> and let
	  <m>\mathfrak B</m> be the enumeration algorithm. Then we can
	  make our membership algorithm <m>\mathfrak A</m> a follows:
	  gien an input <m>s</m>, run <m>\mathfrak B</m> and wait
	  until <m>s</m> appears, if it ever does, stop.
	</p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, in general, when asking <me> x \stackrel{?}{\in} S</me> we
    expect a definitive yes or no answer. So consider the finitely
    presented group <m>G = \pres X R</m>, then the word problem is
    decidable if and only if <m>\mathcal E</m>, the set of reduced
    words representing <m>1</m> in <m>G</m> is r.e. and the set
    <m>F(X)\setminus \mathcal E</m> of reduced words not representing
    the identity is also recursively enumerable. Indeed, in this case,
    there is a procedure which is guaranteed to terminate on any
    reduced word and correctly say whether or not the word is trivial.
  </p>
  <p>
    So how does this work with <xref ref="thm_novikov_boone"/>? Well
    <xref ref="prop_trivial_re"/> says that all trivial elements can
    be enumerated, so what is difficult is to show that some reduced
    word represents a non-trivial element. This is equivalent to
    saying that some word <em>cannot</em> be written as a product of
    conjugates of the relations. Thus, asserting that a word is
    non-trivial, is a <em>non-existence</em> statement: there does not
    exist a product of conjugates of relators that is freely equal to
    some word.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a common theme in mathematics that non-existence proofs are
    difficult. One of the triumphs of geometric group theory is that
    we can solve all three of Dehn's problems for many interesting
    classes of groups. Next lecture we will do this for free groups.

<section xml:id="sec_free_group_dehn"><title>Lecture 7: Solving Dehn's
algorithmic problems in the class of finitely generated free
groups.</title>
<p>
  We already saw that the isomorphism class of <m>F(X)</m> was
  determined by the cardinality <m>n=|X|</m>, so we'll fix the
  following notation <me>
  F_n = \pres{a_1,\ldots,a_n}{}.
</me>
Solving the word problem in <m>F_n</m> is straightforward: bring a
word to reduced form and make the obvious conlcusion.
</p>

<p>
  Although the isomorphism problem is undecidable if you're working
  over arbitrary finite presentations. In practice we usually consider
  the isomorphism problem resricted to a class of groups. For finitely
  generated free groups we are asking whether it is possible that
  <m>m\neq n</m> but that <m>F_n \approx F_m</m>. We will see that the
  answer is "no", but before doing so a couple observations are in
  order.
</p>
<p>
  First of all, we will see later on that for any <m>m,n</m> (in fact
  we could even take the countably infinite cardinal
  <m>m=\aleph_0</m>) there is an injective homomorphisms
  <me>
    F_m \into F_n.
  </me>
  In fact in the early 2000s it was proved that all finite rank free
  groups have the same elementary theory. All this to say that
  directly showing that free groups of different rank are
  non-isomorphic is difficult.
</p>
<p>
  Given any group <m>G</m> we can consider the <term>commutator
  subgroup</term><me>[G,G] = \ncl{\{g^{-1}h^{-1}gh\mid g,h \in
  G\}}.</me> The quotient:
  <me>
    G \onto G/[G,G]
  </me> is called the <term>abelianization</term> of <m>G</m> and it
  is an abelian group since
  <me>
    g^{-1}h^{-1}gh=1 \Rightarrow gh=hg.
  </me>
  Fans of category theory will rejoice to observe that the
  abelianization map is a functor from the category fo groups to the
  category of abelian groups.
</p>
<p>
  For free groups, the abelianization is
  <me>
    F_n \onto F_n/[F_n,F_n] \approx \ZZ^n. 
  </me>
  Now if this were linear algebra we would have <m>\dim(\ZZ^n)=n</m>
  and vector spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have the same
  dimension. Thus
  <me>
    F_n \approx F_m \Leftrightarrow F_n/[F_n,F_n] \approx F_m/[F_m,F_m]
    \Leftrightarrow \ZZ^n \approx \ZZ^m \Leftrightarrow m = n.
  </me>
 Unfortunately <m>\ZZ</m> isn't a field. However, there is a canonical
 algebraic constructions which embeds <m>\ZZ^n</m> into <m>\QQ^n</m>
 (or any <m>\ZZ</m>-module into a <m>\QQ</m>-vector space) is called
 <term>extension of scalars</term> and we get can use linear algebra
 again:
 <me>
   \dim_\QQ\left(\left(F_n/[F_n,F_n]\right)\otimes_{\ZZ}\QQ\right)=n.
 </me>
 So the number <m>n</m> in <m>F_n</m> is determined by algebraic
 structure, and that solves the isomorphism problem.
</p>
<p>
  Actually there is a name for this group invariant.
  <definition xml:id="def_first_betti_number">
    Let <m>G</m> be a finitely generated group then <m>b_1(G)</m>, the
    <term>first Betti number</term> of <m>G</m> is the torsion-free
    rank of the the abelianization <m>G/[G,G]</m>, viewed as a
    <m>\ZZ</m>-module or
    <me>
      b_1(G) = \dim_\QQ\left(G/[G,G]\otimes_\ZZ\QQ\right)
    </me>
  </definition>
</p>

<p>
  Let's now tackle the conjugacy problem. A useful tool for free
  groups is cancellation diagrams. Note that for the remainder of the
  section we will sometimes put a <m>\cdot</m> to denote
  multiplication for emphasis. Let <m>w_1</m> and <m>w_2</m> be
  reduced words then we have the cancellation diagram:
  <figure xml:id="fig_canc_diag">
    <caption>The cancellation bewteen two words.</caption>
    <image width="75%" xml:id="canc_diag" source="images/canc_diag.png"/>
  </figure>
</p>
<p>
And we denote by <m>p(w_1,w_2)</m> the maximal co-terminal subword of
<m>w_1</m> that cancels in the product <m>w_1\cdot w_2</m>. We will
call this the <term>pinch in the product <m>w_1\cdot w_2</m>.</term>
</p>
<p>
  When conjugating <m>u^{-1}\cdot w \cdot u</m> we can obtain different
  combinatorial types of cancellation diagrams.

  Let's now solve the conjugacy problem. The conjugacy class of
  <m>w</m> consists of the set <m>\{g^{-1}w g \mid g \in G\}</m>.

    <title>Lecture 8: Quasi isometries</title>
    <p>
      Back in <xref ref="lec_cayley_graphs"/> we saw that a choice of
      generating set <m>G = \gen A</m> gave rise to a Cayley graph
      <m>\cay A G</m> which in turn endows <m>G</m> with a metric
      <m>d_{\cay A G}</m>. However, the subject matter in the previous
      sections should have reinforced the fact that there should be no
      expectation that such a metric be <em>canonical</em> for the
      group. A surprisingly successful strategy has been to
      simultaneously consider all possible metrics on <m>G</m> that
      arise from choices of finite generating sets. This motivates the
      following definition.

  <section>
    <title>Lecture 9: Can anything be expressed by quasi
    isometry?</title>
    <p>
      Two metric spaces are the same if they are isometric. In the
      previous section we saw although there is no canonical
      <term>word metric</term> on a group, if we consider metric
      spaces only up to quasi isometry, then we do obtain something
      canonical: namely the <term> quasi isometry class of word
      metrics coming from finite generating sets.</term> The issue
      then becomes that maybe quasi isometry is too vague and that all
      groups are quasi isometric. <em>For quasi isometry to be useful,
      it must be able to tell groups apart.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      All finite groups are quasi isometric to the metric space
      consisting of a single point, so this viewpoint is not useful
      for the study of finite groups. We also see that quasi isometry
      is able to distinguish finite groups from infinite groups, but
      that isn't particularly impressive.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this lecture we will show that the groups <m>\ZZ</m> and
      <m>\ZZ^2</m> are not quasi isometric and we will prove <xref
      ref="thm_svarc_milnor"/>, the Svarc-Milnor Lemma, which has far
      reaching consequences such as the fact that if <m>K \leq H</m>
      is a finite index subgroup then <m>H</m> and <m>K</m> are quasi
      isometric. This gives us a limitation of how much can be
      determined by quasi isometry. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Let <m>x</m> be a point in a metric space <m>(X,d)</m>, let
      <m>r\gt 0</m> be some number, then we define the <term>closed
      ball of radius <m>r</m> about <m>x</m></term> to be the set
      <me>
	B(x,r) = \{ y \in X \mid d(x,y) \leq r\}.
      </me>
      When it is clear from the context in which metric space a given
      ball lies, we will not bother explicitly giving the metric.
    </p>

    <p> It is worth recalling from <xref ref="ex_cay_ZZ_ZZ2"/> that
    for any ball about the identity in the standard Cayley graph of
    <m>\ZZ^2</m>, we can find a generating set of <m>\ZZ</m> which
    gives the exact same ball about the identity.  In other words, at
    small and medium scales word metrics will not distinguish
    <m>\ZZ</m> and <m>\ZZ^2</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      The proof of the following is known as an
      <term>asymptotic</term> argument.

	  We take the standard cayley graphs <m>\cay{\{1\}}{\ZZ}</m>,
	  the line, and
	  <m>\cay{\left\{\pmatrix{1\\0},\pmatrix{0\\1}\right\}}{\ZZ^2}</m>,
	  the infinite grid, and equip <m>\ZZ</m> and <m>\ZZ^2</m>
	  with the induced word metric.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Suppose towards a contradiction that <m>\ZZ</m> and
	  <m>\ZZ^2</m> were quasi-isometric. Then there would exist a
	  <m>(K,C)</m>-quasi isometric embeding <m>f:\ZZ^2 \to
	  \ZZ</m>. Consider the balls <m>B(1,r) \subset \ZZ^2</m>, on
	  the one hand they look like diamonds and contain
	  <m>|B(1,r)|=O(r^2)</m> points. On the other hand, because we
	  have a quasi-isometric embedding we have a containment.
	  <me>f(B(1,r)) \subset B(f(1),Kr+C) \subset \ZZ.</me> Since
	  <m>\ZZ</m> is a line we have <me> |B(f(1),Kr+c)| = O(r).
	</me>
	</p>

	<p> Because the cardinality of <m>B(1,r) \subset \ZZ^2</m> grows
	faster than the cardinality of <m>B(f(1)),Kr+C) \subset
	\ZZ</m> the restrictions <m>f|_{B(1,r)}</m> will be far from
	injetive, in partiular as <m>r \to \infty</m> then maximal
	number of preimages of a point in <m>B(f(1),Kr+C)</m> via the
	restrictions <m>f|_{B(1,r)}</m> must also go to infinity.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Pick <m>M</m> so large that any subset of <m>\ZZ^2</m> with
	  <m>M</m> or more elements must have diameter at least
	  <m>K\cdot(1+C)</m> and pick <m>r</m> so large that some
	  element <m>z_0 \in B(f(1),Kr+C)</m> has at least <m>M</m>
	  <m>f|_{B(1,r)}</m>-pre images.
	</p>

	<p>
	  On the one hand there must be elements <m>y,y' \in
	  \ZZ^2</m> such that <m>f(y)=f(y')=z_0</m> but
	  <m>d(y,y')\geq K\cdot(1+C)</m>. But by definition of a
	  quasi-isometric embedding we must have
	  <men xml:id="eq_z2_to-z">
	    \frac 1 K d(y,y') -C \leq d(f(y),f(y'))) = d(z_0,z_0)=0,
	  </men>
	  but
	  <me>
	    d(y,y')\geq K\cdot(1+C) \Rightarrow \frac 1 K (K(1+C)) -C
	    = 1 \leq 0
	  </me>
	  which is a contradiction. It follows that there can be no
	  quasi-isometric embedding from <m>\ZZ^2</m> to <m>\ZZ</m>.
	</p>
      </proof>
    </proposition>

    <p>
      So at least now we have established that quasi isometry is maybe
      not a completely useless notion as it can tell at least two
      groups apart. Quasi isometry, however, does have limitations and
      we will now explore these.
    </p>

    <p>
      From now on we will asssume our spaces <m>X</m> are path
      connected metric spaces, the readier at this point is free to
      assume that <m>X</m> is a connected graph, all of whose edges
      have a given length (usually they have unit length). A
      <term>path</term> is a continuous mapping
      <me>
	p: \underbrace{[0,L]}_{\subset \RR} \to X.
      </me>
      and we can define its speed at <m>s</m> as
      <me>
	|\dot p(s)| = \lim_{h \to 0^+}\frac{d(p(s+h),p(s))}{h}.
      </me>
    If <m>X</m> is a graph, viewing edges as isometric copies of
    intervals of <m>\RR</m> we can make sense of this for almost all
    values of <m>s \in [0,L]</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Integrating speed gives <term>arc length</term> and we say that
    <m>p</m> is <term>arc length parameterized</term> if <m>|\dot
    p(s)| =1</m> for all <m>s \in [0,L]</m>. We say that a path is a
    <term>geodesic</term> if it is a shortest path between its
    endpoints <m>p(0)</m> and <m>p(L)</m> and we can define the
    <term>path metric</term> to be given by the minimal length of all
    paths joining two points. A metric space is called a geodesic
    metric space if its metric coincides with the path metric.
    </p>
    <p>
      We assume the reader knows what a left group action
      <md>
	<mrow> G \times X \amp \to X</mrow>
	<mrow> (g,x) \amp \mapsto g\cdot x</mrow>
      </md>
      on a space is. We will use the <m>\cdot</m> symbol to denote the
      action of a group element on a point. We say that <term><m>G</m>
      acts by isometries</term> on <m>(X,d)</m> if for every <m>g \in
      G</m> and every <m>x,y \in X</m> we have:
      <me>
	d(x,y) = d(g\cdot x,g\cdot y).
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      For our current purposes it will be sufficient to only consider
      our metric spaces to be path connected graphs, but the results
      we state will be be more general. For our purposes a
      <term>compact set</term> is a finite subgraph. An <term>action
      by isometries </term> is an action by graph automorphisms. The
      action of <m>G</m> on a graph <m>X</m> is <term>proper</term> if
      the stablizer of any vertex is finite. The <term> quotient <m>G
      \backslash X</m></term> of an action has vertices that conist of
      equivalence classes
      <me>
	[v] =\{ u \in V(X) \mid \textrm{for some } g \in G, g\cdot u
	=v\}
      </me>
      and edges
      <me>
	[e] =\{ f \in E(X) \mid \textrm{for some } g \in G, g\cdot f
	=e\}
      </me>
      and is itself a graph. The action of <m>G</m> on <m>X</m> is
      <term>cocompact</term> if <m>G\backslash X</m> is finite and a
      <term>coarse fundamental domain</term> is compact subset
      <m>K \subset X</m> whose <m>G</m> translates cover <m>X</m>,
      i.e.
      <me>
	X = G\cdot K.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>With all this terminology out of the way, we can start proving
    results.</p>

    <p>We will first state a useful result without proof. It follows
    from a careful consideration of the definitions.</p>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
	If a group <m>G</m> acts properly, cocompactly and by
	isometries on a graph <m>X</m>, then <m>X</m> is locally
	finite, i.e. all vertices are adjacent to only finitely many
	edges. In particular balls of finite radius only contain
	finitely many elements.
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    

    <lemma xml:id="lem_proper_action">
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Let <m>G</m> act properly and cocompactly on a path
	  connected graph <m>X</m> with a distinguished vertex
	  <m>p_0</m> by isometries. Then the following are true:
	  <ol>
	    <li xml:id="it_proper_1">There is some <m>r_0>0</m> such that <m>X = G\cdot
	    B(p_0,r_0)</m>, i.e. <m>G</m>-translates of <m>B(p_0,r_0)</m>
	    cover <m>X</m>.</li>
	    <li xml:id="it_proper_2"> The subset
	    <me>
	      R_s=\{g \in G \mid g\cdot B(p_0,s)\cap B(p_0,s)\neq \emptyset\} \subset G

	    </li>
	    <li xml:id="it_proper_3">

		S = R_{r_0}=\{g \in G \mid g\cdot B(p_0,r_0)\cap
		B(p_0,r_0)\neq\emptyset\}
	      </me>
	      is a generating set for <m>G</m>, i.e. <m>G = \gen S.</m>
	    </li>
	  </ol>
	</p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
	<p>Let's first prove <xref ref="it_proper_1"/>. Because the
	action is cocompact the quotient <m>G\backslash X</m> is a
	finite graph. Let <m>[v_1],\ldots,[v_k]</m> and
	<m>[e_1],\ldots,[e_l]</m> be the vertices and edges of
	<m>G\backslash X</m> respectively. For vertex each
	<m>[v_i]</m> of the quotient pick some vertex <m>[v_i]\ni \hat
	v_i \in V(X)</m> and for each edge <m>[e_j]</m> of the
	quotient pick some edge <m>[v_j]\ni \hat e_j \in E(X).</m>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Since cells of <m>G\backslash X</m> corespond to
	  <m>G</m>-orbts, for every <m>v \in V(X)</m> there is some
	  <m>g \in G</m> such that <m>g\cdot v = v_i</m> for some
	  <m>i</m> and the analogous statement also holds for
	  edges. Because the set of cells
	  <me>
	    C=\{\hat v_1, \ldots, \hat v_k,\hat e_1,\ldots \hat e_l\}
	    \subset X </me> is finite and <m>X</m> is path connected
	    there must be some sufficiently large <m>r_0</m> so that
	    <m>C \subset B(p_0,r_0)</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Let's now prove <xref ref="it_proper_2"/>. Suppose towards a
	  contradiction that for some set <m>s>0</m> the subset <m>R_s
	  \subset G</m> is infinite. Since <m>B(p_0,s)</m> is finite
	  there must be some vertex <m>v_0 \in B(p_0,s)</m> such and
	  an infinite subset <m>\{g_1,g_2,\ldots\}</m> such that
	  <me>
	    v_0 \in \bigcap_{i=1} g_i \cdot B(p_0,s)
	  </me>
	  Let <m>w_i = g_i^{-1}\cdot v_0</m>. On the one hand <m>w_i \in
	  B(p_0,s)</m>, on the other hand since <m>B(p_0,s)</m> is
	  finite there must be infinitely many <m>w_i</m>'s that are
	  equal, say <me>
	  w_{i_1}=w_{i_2} = \cdots
	</me>
	but then it follows that the elements<me> g_{i_j}g_{i_1}^{-1};
	j=1,2,3,4,\ldots </me> are all distinct, but all fix the the
	point <m>v_0</m>. This contradicts the hypothesis that the
	action of <m>G</m> on <m>X</m> is proper.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Finally we can prove <xref ref="it_proper_3"/>. Consider
	  first the set <me>V = G\cdot p_0 = \{v \in V(X)\mid v =
	  g\cdot p_0, \textrm{ for some } g \in G\}.</me> And suppose
	  towards a contradiction that <m>\gen{S} \subsetneq G.</m>
	</p>

	<p>
	  <em>Claim: <m>\gen S \cdot p_0 = V</m>.</em> Suppose this
	  was not the case, let <m>w_0 = g \cdot p_0</m> be an element
	  of minimal distance from <m>\gen S \cdot p_0</m>. Let
	  <m>u_0 \in \gen S \cdot p_0</m> be a point closest to
	  <m>w_0</m> and let <m>\alpha</m> be a path from <m>u_0</m>
	  to <m>w_0</m> that realizes their distance.
	</p>
	<p>
	  On the one hand there is some <m>s \in \gen S</m> such that
	  <m>s \cdot p_0 = u_0</m>, on the other hand there is some
	  vertex <m>u_1</m> a distance 1 from <m>u_0</m> along the
	  path <m>\alpha</m> which is strictly closer to <m>w_0</m>
	  than <m>u_0</m>. The element <m>s^{-1} \cdot u_1</m> is
	  distance <m>1</m> from <m>p_0</m>. There is some <m>h \in
	  G</m> such that <m>h \cdot p_0 = (s^{-1}\cdot u_1)</m> and
	  since <m>s^{-1}\cdot u_1 \in h \cdot B(p_0,3\cdot r_0) \cap
	  B(p_0,r_0) \neq \emptyset</m> we have that <m>h \in
	  S</m>. It now follows from equations above that <me>sh\cdot
	  p_0 = s\cdot (s^{-1}\cdot u_1) = u_1.</me> Thus, <m>u_1 \in
	  \gen S \cdot p_0</m>, but this contradicts that <m>u_0 \in
	  \gen S \cdot p_0</m> is as close as possible to <m>w_0.</m>
	  <em>This proves the claim.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
	  So suppose finally towards a contradiction that <m>\gen S
	  \subsetneq G</m>. Then there is some <m>G \ni g \not\in \gen
	  S</m>. By the claim above there is some <m>s\in \gen S</m>
	  such that <m>s^{-1}\cdot (g\cdot p_0) = p_0</m>, so that
	  <m>s^{-1}g</m> fixes <m>p_0</m>, but then <m>s^{-1}g \in
	  S</m> which implies that <m>g \in \gen S</m> which is a
	  contradiction.
	</p>
      </proof>
    </lemma>

    <p>
      The proof above illustrates the potent combination of a proper,
      cocompact action by isometries. Such an action is typically
      called <term>a geometric action</term>. The lemma above gives an
      unexpected consequence:
    </p>
    <corollary xml:id="cor_geometrical_fg">
      <statement>

    </corollary>

    <p>
      Recall that the quasi isometry class of a group <m>G</m> is the
      smallest quasi isometry class which contains all word metrics on
      <m>G</m>. In particular the statement below makes complete sense
      without having to specify some metric on <m>G</m>.

      <statement>

      </statement>
      <proof><title>sketch</title>
      <p>First note that by hypthesis
      <m>G\cdot p_0</m> is coarsely dense in <m>X</m> and in fact
      quasi isometric to <m>X</m>. So we need need only show that

	<mrow> f:G \amp \to p_0</mrow>
	<mrow> g \amp \mapsto g\cdot p_0</mrow>

      <p>
	By <xref ref="lem_proper_action"/>, <xref ref="it_proper_3"/>
	<m>S = R_{r_0}</m> is a finite generating set of <m>G</m>,
	therefore(by <xref ref="lem_proper_action"/>, <xref

      So if <m>g = a_1\cdots a_n</m> is a product of minimal length

      we have by the triangle inequality that

      </me>
      which is one inequality we need to show.
      </p>
      <p>
	We now need to bound <m>d_A(1,g)</m> above by some linear

    <title>Lecture 10: Many ended graphs</title>
    <introduction><title>Our motivation: quasi isometric rigidity</title>
  <p>
    We say that two groups <m>G_1,G_2</m> are <term>virually
    isomorphic</term> if they contain finite index subgroups <m>G_i'
    \stackrel{\mathrm{f.i.}}{\leq} G_i</m> and such that there are
    finite normal subgroups <m>K_i \triangleleft G_i'</m>
    (<m>i=1,2</m>) such that: 
    <me>
      G_1'/K_1 \approx G_2'/K_2.
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the previous lecture, we saw that quasi isometry could not
    distinguish between virtually isomorphic groups. The question
    still remains: <em>Can quasi isometry determine a group up to
    virtual isomorphism?</em> The short answer is: no, not always.
  </p>

  <p>
    The longer answer is <em>sometimes, and even negative results in
    this matter tend to be non-trivial.</em> The phenomenon where
    quasi isometry (purely geometric/metric) determines a group
    property up to virtual isomorphism (purely algebraic) is known as
    <term>quasi isometric rigidity</term>. Our goal for the next few
    lectures is will be to prove the simplest possible such result.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_Z_rigid">
    <statement>
      <p> <m>\ZZ</m> is quasi isometrically rigid. That is to say if
      <m>H</m> is some group that is quasi isometric to <m>\ZZ</m> then
      <m>H</m> contains a finite index subgroup <m>H'
      \stackrel{\mathrm{f.i.}}{\leq} H</m> such that <m>H' \approx
      \ZZ.</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
  We first note that all non trivial subgroups of <m>\ZZ</m> are
  isomorphic, so there is no need to pass to finite index subgroups of
  <m>\ZZ</m>. We should also note that there exist infinite finitely
  generated groups all of whose elements have finite order, or put
  differently, none of their subgroups are isomorphic to <m>\ZZ</m>
  (these groups take effort to construct). In particular we will need
  to show that such a group <m>H</m> actually contains an infinite
  order element. The way we will achieve this is via group actions,
  and a quasi isometry invariant known as ends.
  </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection>
  <title>Essential disconnecting sets and many endedness</title>
  
  <p>
    In graph theory, a <term>cutset</term> is a minimal (w.r.t
    inclusion) set of edges whose removal disconnects a graph. Such
    sets of edges abound, for example the set of edges incident to a
    vertex contains a cutset. For infinite graphs we have something
    more interesting: a subset of a graph is an <term>essential
    disconnecting set</term> if its removal disconnets the graph into
    two <em>infinite</em> components. Of most interest to us will be
    <term>finite essential disconnecting sets.</term>
  </p>
  <example xml:id="eg_ess_cutsets">
    <statement>
      <ul>
	<li>In an infinite tree, any finite subset is an essential
	disconnecting set.</li>
	<li> The grid
	<m>\cay{\{\pmatrix{1\\0},\pmatrix{0\\1}\}}{\ZZ^2}</m> doesn't
	admit any finite essential disconnecting sets.</li>
      </ul>
    </statement>
  </example>
  
  <p>
    Before defining what an <term>end</term> is we have the following.
    <definition xml:id="def_many_ended">
      <statement>
	<p>We say a graph <m>X</m> is
	<ul>
	  <li>zero ended if it is finite,</li>
	  <li>many ended if it admits a finite essential disconnecting
	  set</li>
	  <li>one ended if it none of the above are satisfies, i.e. it
	  is infinte but withuot an essential disconnecting set.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	  We say a finitely generated group <m>G</m> is zero, one, or
	  many ended if it has a Cayley graph (w.r.t. a finite
	  generating set) which is zero, one, or many ended,
	  respectively. 
	</p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    We should pause to ponder whether this definition is even
    well-defined: <em>Why couldn't a group have two Cayley graphs, one
    of which is one ended and the other one isn't?</em>
  </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection><title>A digression about paths</title>
  <p>
    At this point we want to provide a perspective on compact
    essential disconnecting sets that is compatible with
    quasi-isometry.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>X</m> is a path connected space (e.g. a connected graph)
    then we already encountered the notion of a geodesic <me>p:[0,L] \to
    X.</me> We can relax this notion to that of a <term>quasi
    geodesic</term> <me>q:[0,L] \to X</me> where <m>q</m> is a
    <m>(K,C)</m>-quasi isometric embedding (where we are equipping the
    interval <m>[0,L]</m> with the standard metric of length on
    <m>\RR</m>.) Now <m>q</m> is not necessarily continuous and can do
    all kinds of strange things. However we can do the following:
  </p>
  <lemma xml:id="lem_pw_geod">
    <statement>
      <p>
	Let <m>q:[0,L] \to X</m> be a <m>(K,C)</m>-quasi geodesic, where <m>L \in
	\ZZ_{>0}</m>, and consider a path <m>q_p:[0,L]\to X</m>
	satisfying the following:<ul>
	<li>For <m>i \in [0,L] \cap \ZZ</m> <m>q_p(i)=q_i</m></li>
	<li>On the open intervals <m>(i,i+1)</m>,
	<m>i=0,\ldots,L-1</m> the restriction <m>q_p|_{(i,i+1)}</m> is
	a geodesic joining <m>q_p(i)</m> and <m>q_p(i+1),</m>
	</li>
      </ul>
      i.e. <m>q_p</m> is a <term>piecewise geodesic</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
	Then for every <m>z\in [0,L]</m> we have<me>
	d_X(q(x),q_p(x))\leq 2(K+C).
      </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </lemma>
  
  <p>
    The concept of a geodesic path is a global notion, and is a bit
    too restrictive. The right notion we want is
    <term>rectifiability</term>, but that takes too much work to
    properly define and justify. If we restrict ourselves to the case
    where <m>X</m> is a graph, then we can make the following
    assumption: <em>every path in <m>X</m> is a piecewise geodesic path,
    specifically it travels through every edge at constant unit
    speed.</em> This way we can ignore analysis and focus on
    combinatorics. 
  </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection><title>Many endedness as a quasi-isometry invariant</title>
  <p>
    Now let us give a more metric characterization of a finite
    essential cut set.
  </p>
  <proposition xml:id="prop_metric_essential">
    <statement>
      <p>
	A locally finite graph <m>X</m> admits a finite essential
	cutset if and only if there is:
	<ul>
	  <li>some point <m>x_0 \in V(X)</m> and a fixed number
	  <m>D>0</m>, </li>
	  <li>two sequences of vertices <m>(x_n),(y_n)</m> with <me>
	  \lim_{n\to \infty}d(x_n,y_n)=\lim_{n\to \infty} d(x_0,x_n) =
	  \lim_{n\to \infty} d(x_0,y_n) = \infty, and </me></li>
	  <li>
	    the following property: every path <m>p_n</m> from
	    <m>x_n</m> to <m>y_n</m> intersects the ball
	    <m>B(x_0,D).</m>
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>

  <p>
    In particular this result says that a finite essential
    disconnecting set is a "bottleneck in the graph". 
  </p>
  
  <corollary xml:id="cor_many_ended_qi">
    <statement>
      <p>
	If <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are quasi isometric graphs, then
	<m>X</m> is many ended if and only if <m>Y</m> is many ended.

  <title>Lecture 11: What is an end, anyway?</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the previous lecture we presented the notion of a <term>many
      ended graph</term>, but didn't quite define what an end was. We
      will do this in this lecture and apply the concept to
      quasi-isometric rigidity.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection><title>Ends are like essential components at infinity.</title>
  <p>
    Previously we defined a locally finite connected graph <m>X</m> to
    be many ended if there was some point <m>x_0</m> such that the
   deletion of some ball <m>B(x_0,r)</m> in <m>X</m> produced multiple
   infinite components.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consider some sequence <m>0\lt r_1 \lt r_2 \lt \ldots</m> of radii
    growing to infinity and denote by
    <me>
      \mathcal{K^i}=\{K^i_{j} \subset X; 1\leq j \leq N_i\}
    </me>
    the infinite connected components of <m>X \setminus
    B(x_0,r_i)</m>. Common sense about sets implies that since we have
    <m>B(x_0,r_1)\subset B(x_0,r_2)\subset \cdots</m> then if
    <m>n>m</m> then each element of <m>\mathcal{K}^n</m> is contained
    in a unique element of <m>\mathcal{K}^m</m> which gives a well
    defined surjective function <m>f_{nm}:\mathcal K^n \to \mathcal K
    ^m</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want you can make a rooted tree where level <m>i</m> is a
    component in <m>\mathcal K^i</m> and the ancestor of each
    component is the element of <m>\mathcal K^{i-1}</m> which contains
    it.

  <p>
    The <term>ends of the graph <m>X</m></term> correspond to the
    infinite sequences <m>K^1_1 \supset K^2_{n_2} \supset K^3_{n_3}
    \supset \cdots</m> of nested components. Formally the set of ends
    is the defined as the set of inverse limits of components
    <me>
      \mathrm{Ends}(X) = \lim_{\leftarrow} \mathcal K^n
    </me>
    with respect to the system of functions <m>f_{nm}, n>m</m>. The
    elements of the inverse limit are formally sequences of infinite
    connected components, and so can be seen as "components" at
    infinity and they are in bijective correspondence with the
    infinite branches of the tree shown in <xref
    ref="fig_inverse_limit"/>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We suppress the concern that ends seem to be highly dependent on
    the choice of growing balls (we will confront this momentarily)
    and will consider two examples.
    <example xml:id="eg_z_and_F_ends">
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Let <m>L</m> be the infinite line (i.e. the standard Cayley
	  graph for <m>\ZZ</m>) and let <m>T_4</m> be the infinite
	  regular tree of valence 4 (i.e. <m>T_4 =
	  \cay{\{a,b\}{F(a,b)}</m>.) In both metric spaces consider
	  the balls <m>B(x_0,1)\subset B(x_0,2) \subset
	  B(x_0,3)\subset \cdots</m>. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>For <m>L</m> we always have that <m>L\setminus
	    B(x_0,n)</m> has exactly two components, so as the balls
	    grow we get the following containements of components
	    <me>
	      \cdots \subset K^2_1 \subset K^1_1 \subset L \supset
	      K^1_2 \supset K^2_2 \supset \cdots
	    </me>
	    so the diagram given in figure <xref
	    ref="fig_inverse_limit"/> has precisely two infinite
	    branches and, so <m>L</m> has two ends, which we should
	    think of as being <m>\pm \infty</m>.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      In <m>T_4</m>, the complement <m>T_4 \setminus
	      B(x_0,n)</m> has precisely <m>4 \cdot 3^n</m>
	      components. In particular each <m>K^n_j \in \mathcal K^n
	      = T_4 \setminus B(x_0,n)</m> contains exactly 3
	      components in <m>\mathcal K^{n+1}</m>. It follows that
	      the ends of <m>T_4</m> are in bijective correspondence
	      with infinite strings of the form:<me>
	      ab_1b_2b_3\cdots, a\in\{1,2,3,4\}, b\in\{1,2,3\}
	    </me> and therefore form an infinite set of continuum size.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
      </statement>
    </example>
  </p>
</subsection>
<subsection>
  <title>Ends are robust</title>
  <p>A <term>compact (or finite)</term> exhaustion of a set <m>X</m>
  is a sequence of compact (or finite) subsets <m>K_1 \subset K_2
  \subset \cdots</m> such that:
  <me>
    X = \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty K_i.
  </me>
  A sequence of balls with a common center whose radii grow to
  infinity is an example of a compact exhaustion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main issue about our definition of ends is that it seems to
    depend on our choice of compact exhaustion. We will state our main
    robustness result, but only sketch a proof. The first item is a
    straightforward, yet non trivial exercise in inverse limits, which
    are beyond the scope of the prerequisites, and the second item is
    obvious given the material that was previously covered, but also
    ultimately depends on inverse limits.
    <theorem xml:id="thm_ends_robust">
      <statement>
	Let <m>X</m> be connected locally finite graph. Then
	<ul>
	<li> the set <m>\mathrm{Ends}(X)</m> does not depend on the
	choice of compact exhaustion, and</li>
	<li>
	  if <m>f:X\to Y</m> is a quasi-isometry, then there is a
	  natural induced bijection
	  <me>
	    \hat f: \mathrm{Ends}(X) \to \mathrm{Ends}(Y).
	  </me>
	</li>
	</ul>
      </statement>
      <proof><title>sketch</title>
      <p>We first sketch the proof of the first point. Let <m>A_1
      \subset A_2 \subset \cdots </m> and <m>B_1 \subset B_2 \subset
      \cdots</m> be two different compact exhaustions of <m>X</m> and
      denote by <m>\mathcal A^i</m> and <m>\mathcal B^j</m> the sets of
      infinite components of <m>X\setminus A_i</m> and <m>X \setminus
      B_i</m> we want to show an identification between the inverse
      limits <me> \lim_{\leftarrow} \mathcal A^n, \lim_{\leftarrow}
      \mathcal B^n </me> but the difficulty is that we may not have a
      well defined map <m>\mathcal A^n \to \mathcal B^m</m> where we
      want to send <m>Z \in \mathcal A^n</m> to the unique component
      <m> W \in \mathcal B^m</m> such that <m>Z \subset W</m> even if
      <m>n>m</m>.</p>
      <p>
	The issue is resolved by observing that for some sufficiently
	large <m>N(m)</m> such maps <m>\mathcal A^k \to \mathcal
	B^m</m> will exist provided <m>k> N(m)</m> and then applying
	the abstract nonsense of inverse limits which enables us to
	consider the inverse limits of the union <m>\{\mathcal
	A^n\}\cup\{\mathcal B^n\}</m> equipped with a compatible
	system of surjective functions.
      </p>
      <p>
	We now sketch a proof of the second point. If <m>K \subset
	X</m> is a finite essential disconnecting set, then it's quasi
	isometric image <m>f(K)\subset Y</m> can be enlarged (by a
	uniformly bounded amount) to a finite essential disconnecting
	set. Furthermore the quasi isometric image of a compact <m>A_1
	\subset A_2 \subset \cdots </m> exhaustion of <m>X</m> gives
	rise (perhaps after bounded enlargement) to a compact
	exhaustion <m>\widehat{f(A_1)} \subset \widehat{f(A_2)}
	\subset \cdots </m>of <m>Y</m>. Again, the image
	<m>f(K^i_j)\subset Y</m> of an infinite component of <m>K^i_j
	\subset X\setminus A_i</m> may not quite lie in a component of
	the counterpart <m> Y \setminus \widehat{f(A_i)}</m>, but if
	<m>n  \gt\gt m</m> then we will have <m>f(K^n_j)\subset
	Y\setminus \widehat{f(A_m)}</m>. The bijection then follows
	from the universal property of inverse limits. !
      </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    Here's an even more informal explanation:<ul>
    <li>given different compact exhaustions of a space, we can always
    find a way to eventually match things up so that we have the same
    ends, and</li>
    <li>Quasi isometries sent compact exhaustions to compact
    exhaustions and finite essential disconnecting sets to finite
    essential disconnecting sets, and everything works out great.</li>
  </ul>
  The main point of all this is that we get a quasi-isometric
  invariant of groups.
  <corollary xml:id="cor_ends_qi">
    <statement>
      Any finitely generated group <m>G</m> has a well defined (up to
      bijection) set of ends <m>\mathrm{Ends}(G)</m>.

  </corollary>

<subsection>
  <title>The quasi-isometric rigidity of <m>\ZZ</m></title>
  <p> We have now developed just enough machinery to show that
  <m>\ZZ</m> is quasi isometrically rigid, what we will prove is
  precisely the following:
  <theorem xml:id="thm_two_ended">
    <statement>
      <p>
	If <m>G</m> has two ends then it contains a subgroup of finite
	index isomorphic to <m>\ZZ</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>  
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's the first step in the proof. Note that in this proof, quasi
    isometry is not used, but rather action by isometries.
    <lemma xml:id="lem_2_ended_Z2">
      <statement>
	<p>
	  Let <m>G</m> be two ended and let <m>X = \cay A G</m> be

	  set <m>\mathrm{Ends}(G) = \{\pm \infty\}</m> and <m>H\leq
	  G</m>, the kernel of this permutation representation is a
	  subgroup of index at most 2.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Furthermore, if <m>C\subset X</m> is a finite essential
	  disconnecting such that <m>E^+,E^- \subset X\setminus C</m>
	  are the two infinite components then there is no <m>h \in
	  H</m> such that <m>h \cdot E^+ \subset E^-</m>.
	</p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
	<p>
	  Since <m>G</m> acts on <m>X</m> by isometries, then in
	  particular it acts on <m>X</m> by quasi isometries, and
	  every compact exhaustion is sent to another compact
	  exhaustion. By <xref ref="thm_ends_robust"/>, this implies
	  that <m>G</m> acts on <m>\mathrm{Ends}(G)</m>. Now if <m>G
	  \onto F</m> is a homomorphism to a finite group then the
	  kernel has index <m>|F|</m>, an the first point follows from
	  the action of <m>G</m> on the two element set <m>\{\pm
	  \infty\}</m>.</p>
	<p>
	  Suppose now that we passed to <m>H</m> (note that we allow
	  <m>H=G</m>) and let <me> \cdots \subset K^2_1 \subset K^1_1
	  \subset L \supset K^1_2 \supset K^2_2 \supset \cdots </me>
	  be some nested sequence of components of complements of sets
	  in a compact exhaustion starting with <m>C</m>. Without loss
	  of generality (reversing <m>E^+</m> and <m>E^-</m> if
	  necessary) we may assume that <m>K^n_1 \subset E^-</m> and
	  <m>K^n_2 \subset E^+</m>, for all <m>n</m>. Then in
	  particular the point <m>\infty</m> corresponds to the chain
	  of inclusions <m> L \supset K^1_2 \supset K^2_2 \supset
	  \cdots</m>. Now if for some <m>h \in H</m> we have <m>h
	  \cdot E^+ \subset E^-</m> then this means that the
	  translated chain <me> <m> L \supset h\cdot K^1_2 \supset h
	  \cdot K^2_2 \supset \cdots</m> is contained in <m>E^-</m>
	  and its terms converge to <m>-\infty</m> so we get <m>h
	  \cdot \infty = -\infty</m> contradicting our assumption that
	  <m>H \leq G</m> didn't permute the ends of <m>G</m>.
	  </me>

	<li>
	  Using the fact that every translate <m>h^n \cdot C, n \in \ZZ
	  </m> cuts <m>X</m> into two components argue that all

	  Argue that <m>\gen h</m> is finite index in <m>G</m> by

	  co-compact. This can be done by showing that every component
	  of <me> X \setminus\left(\bigcup_{n\in \ZZ} h^n\cdot
	  C\right) </me> is finite, so that every <m>g \in G</m> can
	  be joined to an element of <m>\gen h</m> by a finite
	  path. Show that if this is not the case, then it is possible
	  to find an essential finite disconnecting set whose
	  complement has at least 3 infinite components, contradicting

      Much of the material in these lectures is covered in <xref
      ref="book_lyndon-schupp"/>, but this book is difficult to
      read. Stillwell&apos;s book <xref ref="book_stillwell"/> has an
      excellent treatment of algorithmic problems and covers many
      crucial interactions between topology and group theory that
      will not be not covered in this course. Both of these books also
      give important historical accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
      Although the ideas of small cancellation theory have been around
      for many decades the paper <xref ref="art_mccammond-wise"/>
      gives a thorough and modern treatment of the topic. Most
      material on hyperbolic groups will be taken from <xref
      ref="notes_hyperbolic"/>.
      </p>

      <p> The book, which as of 2020, gives the best description of
      the field is Drutu and Kapovich&apos;s <em>Geometric Group
      Theory</em> <xref ref="book_drutu-kapovich"/>. This book also
      has many historical references. Many important topics not
      covered in this book are covered in <xref ref="GGT-park"/> which
      is also called... <em>Geometric Group Theory.</em>
      </p>


      <p>
    	As far as accessible contemporary introductions go, the texts
    	<xref ref="book_bogopolski"/> and <xref ref="book_loh_ggt"/>
    	are at a level similar to this course, but cover different
    	topics.(And yes, so far there are three books with the same
    	title.) <url
    	href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1vwmg8g">Office Hours
    	with a Geometric Group Theorist</url> apparently also gives a
    	good idea of the field. And finally <xref
    	ref="book_groups_and_back"/> is another good introductory text
    	which covers substantially different topics.
